BLU gave me this source code.

Click "tgz" on here https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/arm-eabi-4.7/+/master

Untar/ungzip this file into some "temp" dir

Also clone this repo in the same "temp" dir

Then cd into BLULifeOne and do this:

        ARCH=arm SUBARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=../arm-eabi-4.7/bin/arm-eabi- make zImage

You end up with a zImage that'll work for this phone:

BLU Life One, Android 4.4.4. 
Kernel 3.10.28. 
Build KTU84P. 
Custom build version BLU_XO11Q_V04_GENERIC 14-08-2015 12:15. 
Model Number BLU LIFE ONE.
Processor info. Qualcomm Technologies, Inc MSM8916
Binary firmware:  PR1593801-s3203_n_dsx8232_JTOUCH.img
Binary firmware:  PR1593801-s3203_n_dsx8232_TTOUCH.img

*** NOTE, to get this to compile I had to make duplicates copies of some .h files. the stuff in include/trace: devfreq_trace.h, mdss_mdp_trace.h, mdss_mdp.h ....and msm_csid.h & msm_csiphy.h were copied into the subdir include in their respective sensor-folders. So if you change any of those files, make sure you change the copies too... or fix the Makefiles to just look in the right place or whatever.****

Have fun!
